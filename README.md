# solwiss-tournament

Inspired by [0xMonaco](https://0xmonaco.ctf.paradigm.xyz/) & the future of chain-facilitated PvP games, I created a reference implementation for a Swiss tournament manager in Solidity.

([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament)) 

> The Swiss system is used for competitions in which there are too many entrants for a full round-robin (all-play-all) to be feasible

> A Swiss-system tournament is a non-eliminating tournament format that features a fixed number of rounds of competition, but considerably fewer than for a round-robin tournament; Competitors meet one-on-one in each round and are paired using a set of rules designed to ensure that each competitor plays opponents with a similar running score, but does not play the same opponent more than once. The winner is the competitor with the highest aggregate points earned in all rounds. With an even number of participants, all competitors play in each round.

> In single-elimination tournaments, the best competitor may not necessarily win, because good competitors might have a bad day or eliminate and exhaust each other if they meet in early rounds.


### Example of a Swiss tournament:

### Additional Notes on Swiss Tournaments:

* Swiss tournaments cannot identify a single winner
    * Swiss tournaments should wittle down the contestant pool, and winners should move onto single-elimination brackets
* Contestants may advance to a group where there are no other contestants. For example -- a contestant will go undefeated, and there are no other contestants that share the same win-loss record

* Outcomes of a swiss tournament can yield a set of winners which do not play nicely into brackets (2^x). For example, if there are 10 winners of a swiss tournament, some winners will need to have a "bye" in playoffs.

Please see [Example Configuration](#example-configurations) for possible outcomes of a Swiss tournament

*Created with [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh)*

## This is a **reference implementation** with stuff still being worked on:

* Gas optimizations

* Haven't really thought of reentrancy bugs, so there's probably something out there

Proceed carefully by adding it to your own foundry repo:
```bash
forge install saucepoint/solwiss-tournament
```

# Cookbook

There are two ways of creating a SwissTournament:

1) Roll-your-own contract by implementing `SwissTournament`
    * offers more flexibility in managing additional state
    * attach additional logic to `playMatch()` beyond just resolving for a winner

2) Use the `SwissTournamentManagerFactory` to create a tournament via a transaction. This will deploy a new `SwissTournmanetManager`
    * Requires your Game contract to implement the `IMatchResolver` interface
    * Easily create and facilitate multiple SwissTournaments

In either case, the base `SwissTournament` will handle:
    * Advancing players up and down the lattice
    * Maintain a first-in-first-out queue of matchups

## Implementing `SwissTournament` (RYO)

```typescript
/// >> Inherit `SwissTournament`
contract MockGameSwissTournament is SwissTournament {
    // optionally define state variables required for permission access

    constructor(uint256 _winThreshold, uint256 _eliminationThreshold, uint256[] memory playerIds)
        SwissTournament(_winThreshold, _eliminationThreshold, playerIds)
    {
        // additional constructor logic such as
        // setting initial admin permissions
        // or attaching a Game contract
    }
    
    /// >> Implement playMatch() function body to adhere to SwissTournament
    /// >> Must decorate it with advancePlayers() modifier
    function playMatch(ResultCounter memory group, uint256 matchIndex) internal override advancePlayers(group, matchIndex) {
        
        /// >> Provides information on which players (uint256s) are participating in the matchup
        Match storage matchup = matches[group.wins][group.losses][matchIndex];
        
        /// >> Implement some game logic where given 2 players, return the id of the winner
        uint256 winnerId = YOUR_GAME_LOGIC_FUNCTION(matchup.player0, matchup.player1);

        /// >> update the outcome of the match
        matchup.winnerId = winnerId;
        matchup.played = true;

        // the advancePlayers() modifier will handle advancing the players to the next group
    }

    /// Main entry point for running matchups
    /// Should call SwissTournmanent._playNextMatch()
    /// Optionally add permissions logic
    function playNextMatch() {
        _playNextMatch();
    }
}
```

## Create a `SwissTournament` via a transaction

SwissTournamentManagerFactory.sol handles:

* Creation of a tournament manager (SwissTournamentManager)
    * SwissTournamentManager will call your Game contract's `.matchup(uint256,uint256)`
    * i.e. your game contract must adhere to `IMatchResolver.sol` interface
    * The creator of the contract will have tournament-admin permissions
        * allows the addition of admins
        * allows the setting of `tournament.adminSigner()`
        * admins can call `playNextMatch()` without a valid signature
        * users/players can call `playNextMatch()` using a signed message from `tournament.adminSigner()`

So all you need to do is call `playNextMatch()`
```typescript
// assuming we're in React
// and the tournament organizer wants to run the next match!

import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { useAccount, useProvider, useSignMessage } from "wagmi";
import game from "../abi/YourGameContractOutput.json";

// you can retrieve ABI from etherscan, and save locally to React repo
import factory from "../abi/SwissTournamentManagerFactory.json";
import stm from "../abi/SwissTournamentManager.json";

// deployed contract which implements IMatchResolver.sol
const GAME_CONTRACT = "0xABCDE";
const TOURNAMENT_FACTORY = "0xTOURNAMENT_FACTORY";
const provider = useProvider();
const tournamentCreatorContract = new ethers.Contract(TOURNAMENT_FACTORY, factory.abi, provider);

// add contestants (via their uint256-player-ID) to the tournament
// ordered list by elo. First player (the best) matches against the last player (the worst) in the list
// these can be arbitrary playerIds as long as theyre ints and NOT ZERO
// an even amount of players is required, but is unbounded. Massive 128-contestant Swiss tournaments are possible
const playerIds: number[] = [
    10, 20, 30, 40,
    50, 60, 70, 80,
    90, 100, 110, 120,
    130, 140, 150, 160
];

// number of wins required to stop advancement
const winThreshold = 3;

// number of losses required to be eliminated
const eliminationThreshold = 3;

// create a tournament using the factory
const newTournamentAddress = tournamentCreatorContract.create(
    GAME_CONTRACT,
    winThreshold,
    eliminationThreshold,
    playerIds
);

// get the tournament contract
const tournament = new ethers.Contract(newTournamentAddress, stm.abi, provider);

// add some extra tournament organizers, if necessary
// tournament.addTournamentAdmin("0xNEW_ADMIN");

// Execute the entire tournament
while (tournament.matchBookHead() <= contract.matchBookTail()){
    // tournament admins do not need to provide valid signatures
    // non-admins will need to provide a signature signed by tournament.adminSigner()
    tournament.playNextMatch(0, 0, 0, 0);
}
```

#### Identifying Winners

TBD

Lastly, check out [ISwissTournament](src/interfaces/ISwissTournament.sol) for view functions which provide everything that's needed for displaying the Swiss lattice on a UI.

Pruned Results from [SwissTournament.t.sol:testGenerateCombinations()](test/SwissTournament.t.sol)

Note: with high `win_thresholds`, it is not guaranteed that a "winner" has met the win-condition. **Winners are defined as not being eliminated.** This observation is due to contestants advancing into groups which do not have opponents to play.
